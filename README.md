# TIA2020-Recurrent-3D-DenseUNet

Here, the the training script of our paper 'Lung Cancer Tumor Region Segmentation Using Recurrent 3D-DenseUNet', accepted at 
'The Second International Workshop on Thoracic Image Analysis' at MICCAI2020, is included.  

Please, refer to https://github.com/udday2014/Team_Spectrum for the detailed implementation, which we submitted as a solution for the VIP Cup 2018 lung tumor 
segmentation challenge. We made minor changes from our submission to VIP Cup in our paper that is addressed in this code.
